For this problem, DFS makes more sense because we don't have to traverse the whole tree. If we find the solution in between somewhere, we can just stop and return False. DFS reaches leaves faster than BFS.

DFS uses a stack. BFS uses a queue.
That's not just a clue about implementation, it also helps with figuring out the differences in behavior. Those differences come from whether we visit nodes in the order we see them (first in, first out) or we visit the last-seen node first (last in, first out).

BST Strengths:
* Good performance across the board. Assuming they're balanced, binary search trees are good at lots of operations, even if they're not constant time for anything.
    - Compared to a sorted array, lookups take the same amount of time (O(lg(n))O(lg(n))), but inserts and deletes are faster (O(lg(n))O(lg(n)) for BSTs, O(n)O(n) for arrays).
    - Compared to dictionaries, BSTs have better worst case performanceâ€”O(lg(n))O(lg(n)) instead of O(n)O(n). But, on average dictionaries perform better than BSTs (meaning O(1)O(1) time complexity).
* BSTs are sorted. Taking a binary search tree and pulling out all of the elements in sorted order can be done in O(n)O(n) using an in-order traversal. Finding the element closest to a value can be done in O(lg(n))O(lg(n)) (again, if the BST is balanced!).

BST Weaknesses:
* Poor performance if unbalanced. Some types of binary search trees balance automatically, but not all. If a BST is not balanced, then operations become O(n)O(n).
* No O(1)O(1) operations. BSTs aren't the fastest for anything. On average, a list or a dictionary will be faster.

We are following a greedy approach with this one.
We are also using divide and conquer approach. Solving right and left.
